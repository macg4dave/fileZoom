Title: Add Command Line + Menu Bar integration (command registry, mouse activation, tests)

Summary:
- Introduces a lightweight command-line UI state and input handler.
- Adds a simple command registry (`toggle-preview`, `menu-next`, `menu-prev`, `menu-activate`).
- Menu bar now responds to left-clicks to activate menu items.
- Adds integration tests for menu click activation and command-line command execution.

Files changed (high level):
- `app/src/ui/command_line.rs` (new/updated) — command-line draw + handler wired to command registry.
- `app/src/runner/commands.rs` (updated) — added `execute_command` to run simple text commands.
- `app/src/runner/handlers/mouse.rs` (updated) — left-click on menu activates item.
- `app/tests/ui_menu_interaction.rs` (new) — integration tests for menu + CLI.
- `app/tests/menu_commandline_feature.rs` (new) — unit tests for scrollbar/format/preview integration.

Testing:
- Run `cargo test -p fileZoom --tests -- --nocapture` — all tests pass locally.

Notes / Follow-ups:
- Expand `execute_command` to include a real command registry and history.
- Add persistent CLI history and UI to show previous commands.
- Add mouse-to-menu unit tests with more precise layout assertions if needed.
