# errors_output — UI error templates

# This file contains a small set of human-friendly error message templates
# that the TUI can display. Templates use `{...}` placeholders which calling
# code can replace (e.g. `{path}`, `{err}`, `{details}`). This file is plain
# text/TOML-style to make it easy to edit; the UI code can parse it or load
# it as a simple key/value mapping when needed.
