This directory contains sample files and folders used as fixtures for manual or exploratory testing of the `app` crate.

- `file1.txt` – sample text file
- `dirA/file2.txt` – nested file inside a directory

The automated integration tests create temporary copies of these structures; you can also use them directly for manual runs of the binary.
